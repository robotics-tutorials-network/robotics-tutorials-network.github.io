	<h3>FIRST</h3>
	<p>Robotics Tutorials Network is rooted in FIRST, a non-profit designed to promote and inspire students to pursue STEM. EV3Lessons/EV3Tutorials was a FIRST LEGO League project from 2014. It became so popular that the team never stopped supporting or growing the work. EV3Lessons brought together the whole FIRST and MINDSTORMS community, with people all over the world collaborating to provide robot designs, programing lessons and even translations. In the spirit of community, in January 2017, the Droids founded an online Share & Learn community for FIRST LEGO Leagues on Facebook. It was a much-needed forum for conversations and by 2019, there were 4000 members. Members of the group decided that spinoffs for the other FIRST programs were needed. In 2018, a spinoff from EV3Lessons called FIRST LEGO League Tutorials was founded. In 2019, Robotics Tutorials Network was launched as an umbrella website to house all the websites created by the FIRST Team, Not the Droid You Are Looking For.</p>
